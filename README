catena: a Go implementation of the Catena memory consuming password scrambler

ROADMAP

This release currently has the basic password scrambling functions.
The next release will focus on the other components, particularly
client-independent updates and server relief.


PERFORMANCE NOTES

The benchmark uses the following parameters:
	garlic = 16
	initial garlic = 0
	tweak:
		mode: password hashing
		hash function: SHA256
		salt length: 16 bytes
		additional data: none

My test machine has the following specs:

	avail mem = 8049483776 (7676MB)
	cpu0: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz, 1197.50 MHz
	cpu1: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz, 1197.50 MHz
	cpu2: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz, 1197.50 MHz
	cpu3: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz, 1197.50 MHz

A garlic greater than 25 (with an initial garlic of 0) runs out of
memory; a garlic of 25 takes nearly 10 minutes to complete.

For faster SHA-256 hashing, take a look at github.com/conformal/fastsha256.
With the standard `crypto/sha256` package:

	BenchmarkBasicHash             1        1435149021 ns/op

With the `fastsha256` package:

	BenchmarkBasicHash             1        1083923404 ns/op

The `fastsha256` runs in just over 75% of the time as the standard library
SHA-256 pacakge.
